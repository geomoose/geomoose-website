Where can I get support for GeoMoose?
-------------------------------------

Yes! GeoMoose has a wonderful online community that regularly answers emails on our mailing lists, and any question on our IRC Channel #geomoose on irc.libera.chat.  If you don't have a traditional IRC client, you can try the freenode webchat client at https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#geomoose.


There are also companies that will support, customize, and even host GeoMoose.  You can learn more about them here:
