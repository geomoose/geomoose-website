Welcome to GeoMoose
===================

GeoMoose is a Web Client JavaScript Framework for displaying distributed cartographic data.  GeoMoose has a number of strengths including modularity, configurability, and delivers a number of core functionalities in its packages.  GeoMoose is also very light weight for servers making it easy to handle a large number of users, with a large number of layers, and a large number of services without stressing a server.

The GeoMoose core is written using JavaScript and HTML.  It is entirely possible to run GeoMoose with nothing more than a basic web server (Nginx, Apache, IIS).  GeoMoose 3.0 can perform complex queries like selecting, buffering and drill-down identify all without using a server-side scripting language. We exercise the functionality exposed by WMS, WFS, and other feature services to provide a dynamic experience for the user and easy administration.
